## Mockup

From the `mockup.svg` only the first `measurement list` section is done.
The other sections that should follow is:

- A sort of `storage section`, where you can group and sort different measurement lists.
- `Device Section` to handle and choose the device that is used to make the measurement.
- `Template section`, where you can prepopulate a measurement list with "to be measured" `DistanceID`s


### Foundation:
- Starting from this beautiful [blog post](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/) from Tobias Bernard.
- Therefore using the gnome [mockup svg](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/mockup-resources) as a basic.

### TODOs:
- Make the mobile view accordingly
- Create the `storage section`
- Create the `Template section`
- Think about how the Devices View could look like. Since it doesn't work yet, I have no idea where to start.
- Go from here to Glade for the UI design

### Ideas:
- The idea for the first distance in the Mockup comes from the [IFC definition](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2_TC1/HTML/schema/ifcsharedbldgelements/lexical/ifcdoor.htm). The idea could be to populate a Template with a list of parameters that should be used when taking measurements. Maybe there are other standards, or lists with items there "are to measure"
